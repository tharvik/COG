/**
 * A mesh referes to a set of faces, UV vertices and normals to draw.  A mesh
 * uses  the power  of the openGL VBO indexing.  It means that  all vertices,
 * UV vertices and normals  are stored in openGL buffers and an index "links"
 * them to makes faces.
 *
 * A mesh have a multi-resolution system.  A mesh far from a camera will have
 * a lower quality  than a mesh  near the camera  (less faces will be drawn).
 * The resolution is called "level":
 *	- level 1 : best quality
 *	- level 2 : good quality
 *	- level 3 : medium quality
 *	- level 4 : bad quality
 *	- level 5 : worst quality
 *
 * To assure this multi-resolution system,  the notion of mesh radius have to
 * be instored. It's precisly the distance between the center of the mesh and
 * the farest point. It assures the same treatment to a sphere and a cuboid.
 *
 * The distances for the mesh levels  can be setted by changing in the config
 * file the values of MESH_LEVEL_DISTANCES.
